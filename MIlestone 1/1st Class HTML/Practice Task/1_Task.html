    I have been thinking for some time that I need to go somewhere. But I could
    not understand where to go. On top of that, all the friends are busy with
    their work. I'm going to go somewhere alone without a friend. Once I thought
    to go alone but how to go, where to go, where to stay, thinking about all
    this, I kept tearing my hair. While busy with all these thoughts, a
    different experience came to me with traveling.

    As I love travel so much I was ad with various travel related groups on
    Facebook. One day a post came in front of me that they would hire a
    moderator in a group called Travel Dear Tourists. Those who are interested
    should apply. I immediately applied there and joined as their group host
    which was unexpected for me. They told me I have to go on Cox's Bazar tour
    with them next week.
